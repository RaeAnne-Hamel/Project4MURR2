    info: "Quadplexes and other properties with few residences, are provided with 96 gallon carts similar to those used for the single family curbside program.  Carts are collected on a bi-weekly (every two weeks) basis. Carts placed within 5 meters of the nearest collection vehicle access (usually the back lane) do not need to be rolled out for collection. We will provide VALET service by rolling the carts off the property, tipping them and returning them to their proper place. It is the responsibility of the property to ensure a clear unencumbered path from the cart location to the vehicle. Inaccessible carts (excessive snow, mud, obstructions, etc) or those located further than 5 meters from the recycling vehicle will not be collected."

    image: "https://www.cosmoindustries.com/assets/images/side-by-side-recycling-and-garbage-460x307.jpg"
    info: "Approximately 40% of all waste material generated by Multi-Unit residents consists of paper or recyclable packaging materials such as plastic containers, tin cans or aluminum beverage cans. The majority of MURR properties are serviced by metal bins with sizes ranging from 3 to 8 cubic yards. The bins are collected at least once every two weeks although some bins are collected weekly or even twice a week if required in order to capture as much recyclable material as possible."
